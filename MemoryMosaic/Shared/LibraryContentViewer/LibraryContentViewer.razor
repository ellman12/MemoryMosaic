@*
Used on a lot of different pages like Home, Starred, CollectionView, Memories, Trash, etc. for displaying items in user's library, optionally grouping items together.
Content is dynamically loaded in small chunks as they scroll up or down the page.
Items can be selected, and depending on the page, different options may be applied to them, such as (un)starring, deleting, changing what collection(s) they are a part of, etc.
